// --- Day 2: Password Philosophy ---
// --- Part One ---
// Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest way down to the coast from here is via toboggan.
// The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. "Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!" You ask if you can take a look.
// Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.
// To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set.
// For example, suppose you have the following list:
//   1-3 a: abcde
//   1-3 b: cdefg
//   2-9 c: ccccccccc
// Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.
//
// In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg, is not; it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1. The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within the limits of their respective policies.
//
// How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
//
// Your puzzle answer was 465.
//
// The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *
